  - Undrafted players have a base salary of $0
  - The above rules apply regardless of how a player is acquired, e.g. draft, trade or free agency

### Market Value
  - Players market price, used to set yearly raises, will be set using a Value Above Replacement (VAR) method

  - Player salaries are based on a $300 market price, $1 minimum per roster spot, with all remaining dollars allocated to each player based proportionaly on his VAR versus the total VAR pool.

### Player Contracts
  - Player contract status "resets" only when they are eligible for the free agent auction (e.g., when an owner cuts them in the offseason, or tags them for RFA, or they enter FFA)
  - Players drafted in the rookie draft are on a _rookie contract_
  - Players drafted in the free agent auction are on a _free agent contract_

    - In 2018 only, players on a _rookie contract_ get raises of 25% of VAR-based market prices

# Draft

### Retained vs. Drafted
  - Players on a roster who are kept for the following season by an owner choosing to pay their new salary (prior salary + raise) are classified as *retained*
  - Players obtained via all other means (Rookie draft, Free Agent draft, or undrafted free agent pickup) are broadly classified as *drafted*
  - Retained players keep the classification all year, including trades and being released to the waiver wire

### Rookie Draft
  - Fixed order, non-snake, non-auction

  - Designated RFAs are due at the soft cap deadline
  - Designated RFAs are treated as dropped to Free Agency until the RFA draft when they are dispositioned

  - RFA players will be dispositioned in the first two rounds of the Free Agent Auction draft
  - Owners may not exceed the salary cap during the RFA auction
  - There is no limit to the number of years the same owner may designate an eligible player for RFA

    - The first year of FFA will be the 4th year of the league (2019)
    - Free agents from 2016, kept for 2 consecutive seasons (2017, 2018), become Forced Free Agents in 2019
  - Players on _rookie contracts_ do not enter Forced Free Agency
  - Owners may tag FFA players for RFA
  - Owners who retain a player through RFA still reset the FFA counter to 0

### Free Agent Draft

    - Player's owner may not participate in the bidding process
    - Player's owner has the option to retain the player at winning bid price + $1, or pass
    - Owners may opt to pass during nomination even if they have players designated for RFA
    - Designated RFAs that were not nominated are placed in the FA draft pool
    - Player's owner opting to retain must have enough salary cap room to do so
    - RFA nomination order follows auction draft order (i.e., aligned with last year's finish)
